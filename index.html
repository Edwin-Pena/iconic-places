                    <p class="place__desc">The Acropolis of Athens is the most striking and complete ancient Greek
                        monumental complex still existing in our times. It is situated on a hill of average height
                        (156m) that rises in the basin of Athens. Its overall dimensions are approximately 170 by 350m.
                        The hill is rocky and steep on all sides except for the western side, and has an extensive,
                        nearly flat top.</p>
                    <p class="place__desc">The sanctuary reached its peak in the archaic period (mid-6th century to
                        early 5th century BC). In the 5th century BC, the Athenians, empowered from their victory over
                        the Persians, carried out an ambitious building programme under the leadership of the great
                        statesman Perikles, comprising a large number of monuments including the Parthenon, the
                        Erechtheion, the Propylaia and the temple of Athena Nike.</p>

                    <p class="place__desc">Is the meeting place of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is located
                        in London, England. It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament after the House of Commons
                        and the House of Lords, the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. The palace is
                        the centre of political life in the United Kingdom; "Westminster" has become a metonym for the
                        UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government commemorates
                        the name of the palace.</p>
                    <p class="place__desc">The building was originally constructed in the eleventh century as a royal
                        palace, and was the primary residence of the kings of England until 1512, when a fire destroyed
                        the royal apartments.</p>

                        Hills near Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum designed the
                        sculpture, called Shrine of Democracy, and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941
                        with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum.</p>
                    <p class="place__desc">The sculpture features the 60-foot-tall (18 m) heads of four United States
                        presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, chosen
                        to represent the nation's birth, growth, development, and preservation, respectively. Mount
                        Rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually to the memorial park which covers
                        1,278 acres (2.00 sq mi; 5.17 km2). The mountain's elevation is 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea

                        Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the

                        maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of
                        Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March
                        2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.</p>

                        Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.</p>
                    <p class="place__desc">The statue is a figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. She holds a
                        torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed
                        JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of
                        Independence. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the
                        national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War.</p>

                        famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called moai, which were created by the
                        early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of
                        the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.</p>

                        the island. While many in the research community cited evidence that they arrived around the
                        year 800, a 2007 study found compelling evidence that they arrived closer to 1200.</p>

                        collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted
                        the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its
                        8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.</p>
                    <p class="place__desc">It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ The Redeemer differs
                        considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in
                        one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the
                        design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide..</p>
